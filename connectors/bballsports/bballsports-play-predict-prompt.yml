    description: "Analyze basketball game simulation results from BBallSports API"
    instruction: |
            Analyze the following basketball game data from BBallSports API:

            SIMULATION RESULTS:
            {{ $.get('simulation-results') }}

            PLAYED GAMES LIST:
            {{ $.get('played-games') }}

            BOX SCORES DATA (with analysis context):
            {{ $.get('all-box-scores') }}

            ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
            - Total simulated games: {{ $.get('total-simulated-games') }}
            - Games being analyzed: {{ $.get('analysis-context').get('analyzed_games') }}
            - Note: {{ $.get('analysis-context').get('note') }}

            Please provide:
            1. Summary of the simulation request and results
            2. Analysis of the played games list
            3. Detailed analysis of the box scores data (focusing on the {{ $.get('analysis-context').get('analyzed_games') }} games provided)
            4. Key statistics and performance metrics from the actual game data
            5. Notable patterns or insights from the real game results
            6. Recommendations based on the actual game data
            7. Acknowledge that this analysis covers {{ $.get('analysis-context').get('analyzed_games') }} out of {{ $.get('analysis-context').get('total_simulated_games') }} total simulated games

            Focus on the real game data (played games and box scores) rather than just the simulation request.

            Format the response in a clear and structured manner.
