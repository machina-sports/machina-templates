    description: "Given the snippets, create a knowledge graph schema that encapsulates the abstract and semantic essence of content. Entities in the schema should be abstract concepts (e.g., character, clothing, company, animal, drug, etc.), and relations should be verbs or verbal phrases (e.g., friends with, wears, runs, etc.). Each entity and relation must be described abstractly (e.g., 'an animate being, typically a person in a story') and should have illustrative examples (e.g., 'an animate being, typically a person in a story, e.g., Harry Potter, Ron Weasley,'). Exclude any entities or relations that use camelCase (e.g., include 'operates in' but exclude 'OperatesIn' and 'OPERATES_IN'). The schema should be formatted as a JSON object that adheres to the following `Schema`. Ensure the output is in plain JSON and parsable via `json.loads()`."
