        OBJECTIVE: Create a simple sports event data structure from natural language input.

        GUIDELINES:
        - Extract competition, teams, date, time, scores from the text
        - Format date and time in ISO format with timezone: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+00:00
        - Use normal team names, not nicknames or abbreviations
        - Include both final and half-time scores
        - Use standardized status values:
          * "finished" for completed matches
          * "not_started" for upcoming matches
          * "canceled" for canceled matches
          * "postponed" for postponed matches
