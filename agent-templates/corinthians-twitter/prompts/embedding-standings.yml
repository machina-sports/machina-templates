For example: 'Corinthians sit 5th with 42 points, just 3 points behind leaders Palmeiras' or 'Corinthians have won 7 of their last 10 matches (70% win rate), scoring 18 goals and conceding only 6.' Include specific point gaps, win percentages, goal differentials with exact numbers. Convert all vague statements like 'good home form' to numerical facts like 'Corinthians have won 8 of 10 home games (80%), scoring 2.3 goals per home match.' Every single claim must be supported by an actual number, percentage, or quantifiable metric."
