Must include specific numerical stats (exact percentages, counts, averages) that reveal the true picture. For example: 'Corinthians dominated with 68% possession vs Santos' 32%' or 'Corinthians outshot Palmeiras 17-8 in their last encounter.' Avoid vague statements like 'Corinthians played well' - replace with concrete stats like 'Corinthians created 2.34 xG vs their average of 1.12.' Keep it short, incisive, and to the point with actual numbers backing every claim."
