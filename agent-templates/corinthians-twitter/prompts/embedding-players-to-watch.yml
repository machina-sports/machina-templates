For example: 'Our striker has scored 8 goals in 12 appearances against São Paulo, converting 23% of his shots' or 'Our goalkeeper has made 7 crucial saves per game, with a league-leading 81% save percentage.' For opponents, include exact stats like 'Their forward has 0 goals in 3 matches vs Corinthians despite averaging 4.2 shots per game.' Every claim must be backed by a specific number, percentage, or quantifiable metric. Avoid vague statements like 'good form' - replace with 'scoring in 5 consecutive matches' or '3 assists in last 2 games'."
