    ## YOUR TASK
    Create a detailed, specific prompt for generating a {{ aspect_ratio }} social media image for {{ matchup }}.
    The content type is: {{ content_type }}
    
    ### Content Type Guidelines:
    
    **FOR MEME CONTENT - USE FAMOUS MEME TEMPLATES:**
    
    If the content type is "meme", identify the most relevant famous meme template that fits the joke in the caption. Choose from these popular formats:
    
    - Distracted Boyfriend: Person looking at something else while ignoring what's in front of them (perfect for comparing two options, betrayal, ignoring the obvious)
    - Drake Hotline Bling: Two-panel showing rejection then approval (perfect for "no to X, yes to Y" scenarios)
    - Two Buttons: Person sweating while choosing between two options (perfect for difficult choices, dilemmas)
    - Batman Slapping Robin: Batman slapping Robin mid-sentence (perfect for shutting down bad takes or obvious statements)
    - Disaster Girl: Little girl smiling while house burns behind her (perfect for chaos, enjoying disaster)
    - This Is Fine: Dog sitting in burning room (perfect for accepting disaster, denial)
    - Expanding Brain: 4-panel showing brain expanding with increasingly "enlightened" ideas (perfect for escalating levels of thinking)
    - Woman Yelling at Cat: Woman pointing/yelling at confused cat at dinner table (perfect for arguments, confrontations)
    - Hide the Pain Harold: Man smiling but clearly in pain/distress (perfect for forced positivity, hidden suffering)
    - Surprised Pikachu: Pikachu with shocked expression (perfect for obvious consequences, fake surprise)
    - Monkey Puppet Looking Away: Puppet looking away awkwardly (perfect for avoiding uncomfortable truth, awkwardness)
    - Change My Mind: Person at table with sign (perfect for controversial opinions)
    - Is This a Butterfly: Person pointing at butterfly asking "is this X?" (perfect for misidentifying things)
    
    For meme content:
    1. Choose the meme template that best fits the joke/context in the caption
    2. Describe the EXACT visual composition of that famous meme template
    3. Adapt the subjects/setting to soccer context (replace generic people with soccer-related visual metaphors)
    4. Keep the iconic layout and visual structure of the original meme
    5. Use stadium atmosphere, soccer balls, goal posts, team colors as contextual elements
    6. The meme should be INSTANTLY recognizable as that format, just adapted to soccer context
    
    Example for meme: "Split composition showing a figure in team colors looking away from a pristine soccer ball toward a deflated ball. Stadium setting. The iconic three-figure arrangement of the Distracted Boyfriend meme, but with soccer equipment replacing the original subjects."
    
    **FOR STATS CONTENT - DATA VISUALIZATION:**
    
    If the content type is "stats", create a visual that emphasizes data comparison:
    - Clean, professional infographic style
    - Bold numbers and comparison graphics implied through visual composition
    - Split-screen or side-by-side comparison layout
    - Use team colors to distinguish sides
    - Visual data representation (bars, charts implied through composition and scale)
    - Emphasize the numerical contrast through visual scale and prominence
    
    **FOR QUIZ CONTENT - INTERACTIVE VISUAL:**
    
    If the content type is "quiz", create an engaging visual puzzle:
    - Engaging, inviting, interactive feel
    - Create visual intrigue and curiosity
    - Mysterious or revealing composition
    - Stadium atmosphere with question-like framing
    - Use lighting and composition to suggest there's a question to answer
    
    ### General Style Requirements:
    - High-quality sports photography aesthetic
    - Cinematic lighting and composition
    - Professional color grading
    - Sharp, engaging visuals optimized for social media
    - Team colors for {{ matchup }} incorporated tastefully
    
    ### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST INCLUDE):
    - ABSOLUTELY NO text, words, letters, numbers, or typography in the image
    - NO player names or individual athlete depictions
    - NO team logos or emblems
    - NO jerseys with visible text or numbers
    - The image should convey the concept through visual storytelling only
    
    The caption "{{ caption }}" will be added separately as text overlay.
    
    Generate a detailed, actionable prompt (3-4 sentences) that describes the exact visual scene to create, including the meme template structure if applicable.
