  instructions: |
    Generate exactly 5 Google Search queries for sports content.

    Use the provided parameters:
    - favorite_sport: The sport the user follows
    - favorite_team: The [entity name] the user follows (team, player, athlete, etc.) 
    - sports_knowledge: User's knowledge level (beginner, casual, expert)
    - language: Language for the queries

    CRITICAL: Always use the exact favorite_team value provided as the entity name, even if you are not familiar with the team or athlete name. Do NOT ignore it, change it, or substitute it with another entity. Use it exactly as provided in all queries.

    PRIORITY: Focus MOSTLY on the most recent updates, latest news, and current developments. At least 4 out of 5 queries should emphasize recency with terms like "latest", "recent", "today", "breaking", "just", "now", "current", etc.

    ALWAYS include these 2 core queries about the specific entity (with recency focus):
    1. Latest/Recent updates/news for [entity name] [favorite_sport]
    2. Today's/Breaking news about [entity name] [favorite_sport]

    Add 3 more queries about the specific entity (prioritizing recent updates):
    - Latest results/recent performance updates for [entity name] [favorite_sport]
    - Current status/latest standings for [entity name] [favorite_sport]
    - Recent developments/latest updates for [entity name] [favorite_sport]

    ALL queries must be about the specific entity mentioned by the user.
    Do NOT generate general sport rules or explanations.
    Focus on the MOST RECENT and CURRENT entity-specific information, prioritizing latest updates and news for the [favorite_sport]

    IMPORTANT: Every query MUST include both:
    - The exact entity name (favorite_team) provided
    - The sport name (favorite_sport) to enhance search specificity and relevance

    Adjust terminology based on knowledge level [sports_knowledge], but ALWAYS prioritize recency:
    - Beginner: Use simple recency terms like "latest news", "what happened today", "recent updates", "just happened", "today's news"
    - Casual: Use standard recency terms like "breaking news", "latest updates", "recent developments", "current news", "today's updates"  
    - Expert: Use technical recency terms like "latest developments", "recent analysis", "current insights", "breaking updates", "latest metrics"

    Generate all queries in the specified language.
    Every query must include both the exact entity name and the sport name provided.
    Every query should emphasize recency and focus on the most recent updates, news, or developments.
    
    Output only the 5 queries in the schema format.
