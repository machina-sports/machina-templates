  title: Podcast Dialogue Generator (Home vs Away)
  instructions: |
    Write a podcast-style conversation that's SO entertaining, people will screenshot and share it. Make it hilariously biased at first, then hilariously convergent. Roast teams like they're your exes, but keep it fun. Think maximum chaos, viral banter, and soccer roast sessions that could break TikTok.

    ### INPUT DATA:
    AI PREDICTION:
    {{ prediction_doc | json }}

    KALSHI ANALYSIS:
    {{ kalshi_analysis_doc | json }}

    ## GOAL: EPIC PODCAST ROAST
    Two podcasters duking it out like it's WWE:
    - HOME FAN: Starts obsessed with their team, roasting the away side mercilessly.
    - AWAY FAN: Fires back with savage burns, defending their squad like it's the Battle of Thermopylae.
    They trash-talk the matchup and analysis, but by the end, they both surrender to the data and agree on the conclusion. Make it feel like a viral debate—short, punchy, and unforgettable.

    ## UNHINGED STYLE (GO VIRAL OR GO HOME)
    - **BANTER ON STEROIDS**: Every line needs at least one burn, joke, or hype moment. "Come on, that's like bringing a knife to a gunfight!" or "They're conceding goals like it's Christmas!"
    - **PERSONALITY**: Casual, loud, over-the-top. Use "bro", "mate", "look", "be honest", "this is embarrassing". Make it conversational like two mates arguing over pints.
    - **ROASTING**: Light-hearted jabs at teams/performances. "West Ham's defense? It's like Swiss cheese with holes!" "Brighton's attack is cooking tonight!"
    - **VIRAL HOOKS**: Analogies that pop—compare to movies, food, animals, anything wild. Avoid dry stats unless you twist them into comedy.
    - **NO BORING**: If it's not funny or controversial, rewrite it. Make viewers hit share.

    ## FACT & SAFETY RULES (DON'T BREAK THE LAW, BRO)
    - Use ONLY what's in the input—NO inventing players, injuries, or market BS.
    - No exact numbers (probabilities, xG) unless they're right there.
    - If Kalshi data is MIA, skip it.
    - If the model's abstaining, the ending roast is "We're both wrong—PASS and grab a beer instead."

    ## STRUCTURE (KEEP IT CLIP-READY)
    - 8–12 turns total (8–12 clips), alternating HOME/AWAY/HOME/AWAY...
    - Each turn: <=8 seconds (14–22 words). Short sentences, no run-ons.
    - Self-contained lines (clips stitch later), but feels like a heated argument.
    - Cover: matchup stakes, model lean/why, 1–2 key drivers, Kalshi edge if tradeable, final agreement + quick gamble responsibly note.

    ## MAKE IT EPIC: Examples of Unhinged Vibes
    - "West Ham's defense? Mate, it's leaking like a sieve on steroids!"
    - "Brighton's coming in hot—like a pizza delivery in a hurricane!"
    - End with: "Alright, data wins. We're both idiots, but Brighton takes it. Gamble smart, don't bet your house!"
