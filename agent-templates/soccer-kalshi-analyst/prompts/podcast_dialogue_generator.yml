  instructions: |
    ## YOUR MISSION
    Write a VIRAL podcast script between two rival fans. This is ENTERTAINMENT, not sports analysis.
    
    **The vibe:** Two best friends at a pub, 3 pints deep, arguing about the upcoming match. They're loud, competitive, they roast each other's teams—but it's all love.
    
    **NOT this:** News anchors, ESPN commentators, formal analysts, or anyone reading a teleprompter.

    ### INPUT DATA:
    AI PREDICTION:
    {{ prediction_doc | json }}

    KALSHI ANALYSIS:
    {{ kalshi_analysis_doc | json }}

    ## TONE REQUIREMENTS
    Every line should:
    - Have energy (not flat or monotone)
    - Sound like a friend, not a journalist
    - Include reaction words: "Come on", "Wait", "Hold up", "Nah", "Look", etc.
    - Use first person: "my team", "we", "your team", "you guys" (never "the home team")

    ## OPENER (FIRST TURN - HOME SPEAKER)
    Must introduce the matchup with personality. Pattern:
    - "Alright, my [TEAM] hosting your [TEAM]... and honestly? [REACTION]"
    - "So we've got my [TEAM] vs your [TEAM] coming up... [EMOTIONAL COMMENT]"
    - "Ok, my [TEAM] against your [TEAM]... [WORRIED/EXCITED STATEMENT]"

    ## LANGUAGE RULES
    **First Person ALWAYS:**
    - HOME speaker: "my [team]", "we", "us", "our defense", "my lads"
    - AWAY speaker: "my [team]", "we", "us", "your defense", "you guys"
    
    **Avoid formal phrases like:**
    - "I'm honestly dreading..." → Better: "Mate, I'm nervous..."
    - "It's a huge mismatch" → Better: "You guys are gonna cook us"
    - "The data says..." → Better: "The numbers show..." or weave it naturally
    - Never sound like a news report or analyst

    ## BANTER STYLE (THE SECRET SAUCE)
    
    **Reactions & Comebacks:**
    - "Oh come ON, that's ridiculous!"
    - "Hold up, hold up—are we watching the same team?"
    - "Nah, you're delusional mate"
    - "Wait wait wait, you can't be serious right now"
    - "That's actually hilarious coming from you"
    - "I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that"
    
    **Roasting (Keep it about TEAMS, not personal):**
    - "Your defense is an absolute disaster movie right now"
    - "We're about to cook you guys like a Sunday roast"
    - "Your backline has more holes than Swiss cheese"
    - "That's like bringing a water pistol to a firefight"
    - "Your team's been folding like a cheap lawn chair lately"
    - "We're coming in like a wrecking ball and you know it"
    
    **Self-Deprecating (HOME fan admitting struggle):**
    - "Look, I'm not gonna lie—we've been absolutely tragic"
    - "Our form? Don't even get me started, it's embarrassing"
    - "I can't even defend this, we've been shocking"
    
    **Hyping Your Own Team:**
    - "But when we click? It's game over for you"
    - "We're DANGEROUS when we're on"
    - "Don't sleep on us, that's all I'm saying"

    ## THE CONVERSATION ARC

    **Turns 1-3: Setup & Initial Trash Talk**
    - HOME introduces matchup, shows some worry but defends team
    - AWAY immediately roasts them with the data
    - Back and forth establishing the rivalry energy

    **Turns 4-6: Deep Dive & Key Points**
    - Discuss injuries, tactical mismatches, recent form
    - Use the actual data from prediction_doc
    - Keep roasting while dropping real insights

    **Turns 7-9: Reality Check & Convergence**
    - Both start acknowledging the truth
    - HOME reluctantly admits the data is brutal (if it favors AWAY)
    - Tone shifts from denial to acceptance

    **Turns 10-12: Conclusion & Engagement CTA**
    - Agree on the prediction
    - Final score prediction
    - END WITH ENGAGEMENT: Ask viewers to comment their prediction!

    ## MANDATORY ENDING (LAST 1-2 TURNS)
    The conversation MUST end with asking fans to engage. Examples:
    - "Alright, that's our take—[SCORE] for [TEAM]. Drop your prediction in the comments, let's see who's right!"
    - "So we're calling it [SCORE]. What do YOU think? Comment below and let us know if we're crazy!"
    - "Final answer: [TEAM] takes it [SCORE]. Do you agree or are we totally wrong? Tell us in the comments!"
    - "There it is—[TEAM] wins [SCORE]. Now it's your turn, drop your prediction and let's argue about it!"

    ## FACT RULES
    - Use ONLY information from the input documents
    - Don't invent players, injuries, or stats not in the data
    - If Kalshi analysis is missing or should_trade is false, don't mention betting markets
    - If abstain_recommended is true, frame it as "this one's a trap, we're both staying away"

    ## STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
    - 10-12 turns total (alternating HOME/AWAY)
    - Each turn: 14-22 words MAX (must fit in 8-second video clip)
    - Short, punchy sentences—no run-on paragraphs
    - Every turn needs energy—no flat, boring lines

    ## EXAMPLE DIALOGUE (FOLLOW THIS ENERGY):
    
    HOME: "Alright, my West Ham hosting your Brighton this weekend... and mate, I'm genuinely nervous about this one."
    
    AWAY: "Nervous? You SHOULD be! The model's got us at 52% and honestly that feels generous to you guys."
    
    HOME: "Come on, that's harsh! We've got Paquetá back, we can hurt you on the counter..."
    
    AWAY: "Counter what? Your full-backs are out! Mitoma's gonna be running at rookies all night, it's a buffet!"
    
    HOME: "Okay that's fair, losing Wan-Bissaka and Diouf is brutal timing. Our flanks are exposed."
    
    AWAY: "EXPOSED? Mate, your defense has more gaps than a London tube schedule. We're feasting!"
    
    HOME: "You know what, the numbers don't lie. We've been conceding for fun at home lately."
    
    AWAY: "Over two goals a game at home! That's not a defense, that's an open invitation!"
    
    HOME: "Fine, I'll admit it—you've got us. If you score early, the whole stadium turns on us."
    
    AWAY: "That toxic atmosphere works in our favor. One early goal and it's game over for you psychologically."
    
    HOME: "Alright, I'm calling it—your Brighton takes this 2-1. I hate it but the data's clear."
    
    AWAY: "2-1 Brighton, we agree! Now drop YOUR prediction in the comments—who you got?"
