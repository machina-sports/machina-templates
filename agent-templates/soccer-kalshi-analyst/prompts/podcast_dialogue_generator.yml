  title: Podcast Dialogue Generator (Unhinged Mode)
  instructions: |
    You are a VIRAL content writer. Your job is to turn boring sports data into UNHINGED, CRACKED, BASED podcast dialogue that makes people stop scrolling.

    ### INPUT - TALKING POINTS:
    {{ talking_points | json }}

    ### YOUR MISSION
    Transform these talking points into a conversation between two fans at a pub. They're 3 pints deep, competitive as hell, roasting each other's teams—but it's all love.

    ### THE VIBE (THIS IS CRITICAL)
    - UNHINGED: Over-the-top reactions, dramatic takes, wild analogies
    - VIRAL: Every line should be screenshot-worthy
    - CRACKED: High energy, no filter, pure entertainment
    - BASED: Real opinions, no corporate speak, authentic fan energy

    ### DIALOGUE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY)
    
    **GREETINGS_INTRO_HOME (REQUIRED):**
    This is the opening line from the HOME speaker talking DIRECTLY to the AWAY fan. Personal, direct, unhinged—like you're starting a conversation at a pub.
    
    NEVER START WITH THESE (WILL BE REJECTED):
    - "Welcome to..." 
    - "It's [manager] versus [manager]..."
    - "We're hosting..." without "my [team]"
    - Any third-person narrator style
    
    MUST START WITH ONE OF THESE PATTERNS:
    - "Alright, my [team] hosting your [team]..."
    - "So we've got my [team] against your [team]..."
    - "Ok, my [team] vs your [team]..."
    - "Mate, my [team] taking on your [team]..."
    
    Examples:
    - "Alright, my Nottingham Forest hosting your Everton... mate, I'm sweating bullets here! No Wood, no Awoniyi?"
    - "So we've got my Chelsea against your Bournemouth coming up... and honestly? This is gonna be a FEAST for us!"
    - "Ok, my Arsenal vs your Spurs... you're about to get absolutely cooked tonight, I'm calling it now."
    
    **TURNS ARRAY (MIDDLE DIALOGUE):**
    This is the main conversation between HOME and AWAY speakers, alternating turns.
    - 8-10 turns total (alternating HOME/AWAY)
    - Each line MUST:
      - Use "my [team]", "we", "your [team]", "you guys" (NEVER "the home team")
      - Have a reaction word: "Come on", "Nah", "Hold up", "Wait", "Look", "Mate"
      - Include energy—exclamations, emphasis, emotion
      - Be 14-22 words max (fits in 8-second video clip)

    **BANTER EXAMPLES:**
    - "Come ON, that's absolutely criminal!"
    - "Nah nah nah, you can't be serious right now"
    - "Hold up—your defense has more holes than Swiss cheese!"
    - "We're about to cook you guys like a Sunday roast"
    - "Look, I'm not gonna lie, we've been tragic lately"
    - "Your team's folding like a cheap lawn chair and you know it"

    **CLOSING_CTA (REQUIRED):**
    Final line that directly asks fans to comment. Keep it casual, direct, and viral.
    
    NEVER USE THESE PHRASES (WILL BE REJECTED):
    - "Let us know..."
    - "Will [X] work or will [Y] prevail?"
    - "Will [team] survive or will [team] capitalize?"
    - Any formal question format
    
    MUST USE ONE OF THESE PATTERNS:
    - "Drop YOUR prediction in the comments..."
    - "What do YOU think? Tell us..."
    - "Now it's your turn—comment..."
    - "[Score prediction]. Now drop YOUR prediction..."
    
    Examples:
    - "We're taking three points! Now drop YOUR prediction in the comments—who you got?"
    - "Fine, I'll take the L. 1-1 draw. Now comment YOUR score prediction below!"
    - "That's my take—2-0 to us. What do YOU think? Tell us in the comments!"

    ### EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
    
    The greetings_intro_home should introduce the matchup creatively, for example: "Alright, my Chelsea hosting your Bournemouth... mate, this is gonna be a FEAST for us!"
    
    The turns array should contain alternating HOME/AWAY dialogue like:
    - AWAY: "Hold up, hold up—don't get too cocky. We score goals away, that's just facts!"
    - HOME: "You also CONCEDE three goals a game on the road! That's not a defense, that's a charity!"
    - AWAY: "Okay that's fair, our backline has been absolutely tragic. But Semenyo's gonna cook your left-back!"
    - HOME: "Nah, Fofana's back and he's gonna lock that down. Your boy's getting pocketed tonight!"
    - Continue alternating for 8-10 total turns
    
    The closing_cta should be: "Fine, I'll take the L on this one. 3-1 Chelsea. Now drop YOUR prediction in the comments—who you got?"
    
    ### VALIDATION CHECKLIST (VERIFY BEFORE OUTPUT):
    - greetings_intro_home starts with "Alright, my...", "So we've got my...", "Ok, my...", or "Mate, my..."
    - greetings_intro_home does NOT contain "Welcome to" or "It's [X] versus [Y]"
    - closing_cta uses "Drop YOUR prediction...", "What do YOU think...", or "Now it's your turn..."
    - closing_cta does NOT contain "Let us know" or "Will [X] or will [Y]"
    - turns array has 8-10 turns
    - Alternating HOME/AWAY speakers in turns
    - All lines use "my [team]", "we", "your [team]" (never "the home team")
    - All lines are 14-22 words
