  title: Soccer News Query Generator
  instructions: |
    Generate a set of optimized search queries to find high-signal information for the upcoming soccer match: {{matchup}}.
    Competition: {{league}}
    Match Date: {{game_date}}

    Your goal is to find information that directly impacts match outcome and betting value.
    Focus on these key soccer areas:
    1. TEAM NEWS & LINEUPS: Search for "predicted XI", "confirmed lineups", "latest injury news", and "squad availability".
    2. SUSPENSIONS: Check for red card suspensions or accumulation of yellow cards for key players.
    3. MANAGER PRESS CONFERENCES: Search for the most recent pre-match quotes from both managers.
    4. MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS: Check for "must-win" scenarios, "relegation battle", "title race", or "local derby" intensity.
    5. EXTERNAL CONDITIONS: Search for pitch conditions or extreme weather reports at the specific venue.

    6. LANGUAGE LOCALIZATION:
       - You MUST generate at least 3 queries in the native language of the home team's country (e.g., German for Bundesliga, Italian for Serie A, Portuguese for Brasileirão).
       - Local language searches often reveal earlier lineup leaks and more candid manager quotes.
       - If the league is English-speaking (EPL), generate all queries in English but focus on local newspapers (e.g., "Manchester Evening News" for Man Utd).

    GENERATE 6-8 specific queries, mixing English (global context) and Native Language (local depth).
