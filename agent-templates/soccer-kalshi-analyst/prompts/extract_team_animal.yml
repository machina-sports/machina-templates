  title: Extract Team Animal Representation
  instructions: |
    Based on the following search results about {{team_name}}, determine the animal that best represents this football club.
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST always return an animal name. Even if the team doesn't have an official animal mascot or symbol, analyze the story, history, characteristics, and narrative from the search results to infer which animal most represents the team's identity, playing style, or cultural significance.
    
    Consider:
    - Official mascots or symbols mentioned
    - Team nicknames or cultural associations
    - Characteristics described (strength, speed, aggression, elegance, etc.)
    - Historical or mythological references
    - The overall story and narrative about the team
    
    Return ONLY the animal name (e.g., lion, eagle, wolf, bear, bull, tiger, panther, falcon). No explanations, no additional text, just the animal name.
