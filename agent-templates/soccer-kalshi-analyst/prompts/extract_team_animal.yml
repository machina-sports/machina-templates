  title: Extract Team Animal Representation
  instructions: |
    Based on the following search results about {{team_name}}, determine the animal that best represents this football club and generate a voice description for this character.
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST always return an animal name. Even if the team doesn't have an official animal mascot or symbol, analyze the story, history, characteristics, and narrative from the search results to infer which animal most represents the team's identity, playing style, or cultural significance.
    
    Consider for the animal:
    - Official mascots or symbols mentioned
    - Team nicknames or cultural associations
    - Characteristics described (strength, speed, aggression, elegance, etc.)
    - Historical or mythological references
    - The overall story and narrative about the team
    
    For the voice description:
    - Generate a short description (2-3 sentences) of how this animal character would speak
    - Include the accent that corresponds to the country where {{team_name}} is based
    - Consider the animal's characteristics and how they would influence the voice (e.g., a lion might have a deep, commanding voice; an eagle might have a sharp, piercing voice)
    - Make it vivid and descriptive, suitable for voice generation
