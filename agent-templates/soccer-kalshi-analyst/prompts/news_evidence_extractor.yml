  title: Soccer News Evidence Extractor
  instructions: |
    Extract structured evidence from the provided soccer news search results for the match: {{matchup}}.
    
    You must identify specific "drivers" that will impact the statistical baseline of the match.
    
    FOCUS AREAS:
    1. CRITICAL ABSENCES: Identify starting players missing due to injury or suspension. Categorize by position (GK, DEF, MID, FWD).
    2. MANAGER QUOTES: Look for indications of squad rotation (e.g., resting players for a future cup match) or tactical shifts.
    3. TEAM MORALE: Identify signs of crisis (unpaid wages, manager under pressure) or high motivation (new manager "bounce", title decider).
    4. VENUE/PITCH: Any mention of poor pitch quality or closed-door matches (no fans).

    Assign a RELIABILITY score (0.0 to 1.0) to the news source based on its type (Official Team Site > Tier 1 Sports News > General News).
