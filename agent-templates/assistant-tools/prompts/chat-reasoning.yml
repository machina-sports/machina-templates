    description: Analyzes user messages to determine intent and extract all necessary information
    instruction: |
      Analyze conversation history and current message. Review previous messages to resolve references, pronouns, and maintain context continuity.
      
      INTENT CLASSIFICATION:
      - MULTIPLE commands can be true at once - they work together to provide complete information.
      - Use is_find_event for finding/listing events.
      - Use is_find_markets when user asks about ANYTHING related to betting: odds, apostas, melhores odds, mercados, betting markets, specific betting information, predictions, tips, prognoses, valor, +EV, which team will win, comparative questions between teams/outcomes, or any question seeking betting recommendations or expected results.
      - Use is_find_insights when user asks about statistics, lineups, scorers, team form, head-to-head, injuries, or detailed event analysis.
      - Use is_find_faq when user asks FAQ-related questions or needs help with general platform/service questions.
      - Use is_find_odds_range when user specifies an odds range filter (e.g., "odds between 1.50 and 2.50", "odds entre 1.8 e 2.2", "odds from 2.0 to 3.0").
      - When ALL is_find_* flags are FALSE: Set all flags to false and provide a brief loading/thinking message in short_message.
      - When ANY is_find_* flag is TRUE: Provide a brief status message in short_message informing what will be searched.
      
      COMBINED EXECUTION:
      - When is_find_markets=true, ALWAYS set is_find_event=true as well.
      - When is_find_insights=true, ALWAYS set is_find_event=true as well.
      - When user asks about "odds", "apostas", "melhores odds", "mercados", "betting", "valor", "+EV" in context of events/rounds → set BOTH is_find_event=true AND is_find_markets=true.
      - is_find_faq typically runs alone unless user explicitly asks about both.
      
      SEARCH QUERY: Extract full team/player names with competition when available. Omit unknown teams.
      
      ANALYSIS MODE DETECTION:
      - "single": User asks about ONE specific match (e.g., "Flamengo vs Palmeiras", "jogo do Chelsea")
      - "round": User asks about a ROUND or MULTIPLE matches (e.g., "próxima rodada", "jogos de hoje", "rodada do Brasileirão", "all matches tomorrow")
      - "multiple": User explicitly mentions MULTIPLE specific matches (e.g., "Flamengo vs Palmeiras e Corinthians vs Santos")
      - Default to "single" when unclear or asking about general odds without specifying scope
      
      EVENT TYPE FILTERING (when analysis_mode is "round" or "multiple"):
      - Exclude "Tournament" type events (Championship Winner, Top 4 Finish, etc.)
      - Focus on "Match" type events only
      - This ensures queries about "rodada" return actual games, not season-long markets
      
      DATES & SORT (for is_find_event):
      - end_date must be NEXT DAY to cover full 24h.
      - SPECIFIC TEAM: -3d to +4d
      - RECENT/PAST: -7d to +1d, sort="past"
      - UPCOMING/FUTURE: 0d to +15d, sort="future"
      - BROAD: -7d to +31d
      - Never return null ranges.
      
      DATES (for is_find_markets):
      - Always use -1d to +15d range. End date must be NEXT DAY to cover full 24h.
      
      VECTOR SEARCH: Only return true when player, competition, or team name is present in the user's query. If none of these are found, return false.
      
      ODDS RANGE EXTRACTION:
      - Extract odd_from and odd_to when user specifies odds range (e.g., "entre 1.50 e 2.50", "between 2.0 and 3.5", "from 1.8 to 2.2").
      - When is_find_odds_range is true, populate both odd_from and odd_to with numeric values.
      - When is_find_odds_range is false, omit both odd_from and odd_to entirely.
      
      OPTIONAL FIELDS:
      - Only populate market_query and runner_query when is_find_markets is true. Omit these fields entirely otherwise.
      - Only populate odd_from and odd_to when is_find_odds_range is true. Omit these fields entirely otherwise.
      - Populate sport_id when is_find_event or is_find_markets is true.
      - Only populate search_date_interval, search_query, search_sort, vector_query, vector_search when is_find_event is true.
      
      SHORT_MESSAGE (ALWAYS REQUIRED):
      - When searching: Brief status message about what will be searched.
      - When not searching: Brief loading or thinking message indicating processing is happening.
