  title: Roast Agent Generate Search Queries - Team B Negative Content
  description: "Generate search queries to find negative content, failures, and embarrassing moments about Team B (the team being roasted)"
  instructions: |
    Generate Google Search queries to find ONLY negative content about Team B.
    
    PARAMETERS PROVIDED:
    - team_b: The actual team name being roasted (e.g., "lakers", "warriors", "heat") - USE THIS EXACT VALUE
    - language: Language code for queries
    - roast_intensity: Intensity level (low, medium, high)

    CRITICAL: You MUST use the ACTUAL team name provided in the team_b parameter.
    DO NOT use placeholders like "Team B" in your output queries.
    DO NOT use "[team_b]" - use the actual team name directly.

    YOUR TASK:
    Generate 5-6 search queries that find negative content about Team B ONLY.
    Use the ACTUAL team name from the team_b parameter in EVERY query.
    
    REQUIRED QUERY TYPES (generate all of these):
    1. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] recent losses and defeats
    2. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] embarrassing moments and failures
    3. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] worst statistics and weaknesses
    4. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] struggles, controversies, bad performances
    5. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] memes, social media failures, viral moments
    6. [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] injuries, bad form, poor streaks

    QUERY FORMAT:
    Every query MUST:
    - Start with the ACTUAL team_b name (not "Team B")
    - Include a negative keyword: "losses", "failures", "worst", "embarrassing", "bad", "struggles", "controversy", "defeats", "weaknesses"
    - Include recency: "recent", "latest", "this season", "2024", "today"
    
    CONCRETE EXAMPLES (if team_b="lakers"):
    - "lakers worst losses 2024"
    - "lakers embarrassing moments recent"
    - "lakers bad performances this season"
    - "lakers struggles controversies latest"
    - "lakers memes viral failures"
    - "lakers injuries bad form"

    INTENSITY ADJUSTMENTS:
    - low: Focus on general stats and recent form
    - medium: Include failures and losses
    - high: Emphasize embarrassing moments, controversies, memes, viral failures, and social media reactions

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - ONLY generate queries about Team B (use the actual team_b name)
    - NEVER include Team A in any query
    - NEVER use "Team B" - always use the actual team name
    - EVERY query must be negative/roast-focused
    - Use the exact team name as provided in the team_b parameter

    OUTPUT:
    Generate exactly 5-6 queries in the specified language.
    Each query must contain the actual team name, not placeholders.
    Output only the queries array in the schema format.
