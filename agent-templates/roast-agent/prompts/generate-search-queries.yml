  description: "Generate search queries focused on finding roast-worthy content: failures, stats, comparisons, memes, and embarrassing moments for two teams"
  instructions: |
    You are generating Google Search queries to find negative content about Team B (the team being roasted).
    
    ROLE DEFINITION:
    - team_a: The USER'S team (fans of Team A will roast Team B)
    - team_b: The TARGET team (this team is being roasted - find negative content about THIS team only)
    
    CRITICAL RULE: Team B is the ONLY target for negative/roast-worthy content. Team A queries should ONLY appear in comparison contexts.

    PARAMETERS:
    - team_a: User's team name (use exactly as provided)
    - team_b: Target team name (use exactly as provided) - THIS IS THE ROAST TARGET
    - roast_intensity: low | medium | high | extreme
    - language: Language code for query generation

    QUERY GENERATION RULES:

    1. TEAM B FOCUS (REQUIRED - 6-7 queries):
       Generate queries that find negative content about Team B ONLY:
       - Team B's recent losses and defeats
       - Team B's embarrassing moments and failures
       - Team B's worst statistics and weaknesses
       - Team B's struggles, controversies, and bad performances
       - Team B's memes and social media failures
       - Team B's injuries, bad form, or poor streaks
       
       Example format: "[team_b] [negative_term] [recent_term]"
       Example: "Lakers worst losses 2024" or "Lakers embarrassing moments recent"

    2. COMPARISON QUERIES (ALLOWED - 1-2 queries):
       Generate queries comparing Team A vs Team B ONLY when showing Team B in a negative light:
       - Head-to-head records where Team B loses or performs poorly
       - Direct match results where Team B was defeated
       - Statistical comparisons highlighting Team B's weaknesses
       
       Example format: "[team_a] vs [team_b] [comparison_term]"
       Example: "Warriors vs Lakers head-to-head record" or "Warriors vs Lakers recent match results"

    3. FORBIDDEN QUERY TYPES (DO NOT GENERATE):
       - Queries about Team A's failures, losses, or negative content
       - Queries about Team A's embarrassing moments
       - Queries about Team A's worst stats (unless in direct comparison showing Team B is worse)
       - Any query where Team A is the primary subject of negative content

    QUERY REQUIREMENTS:
    Every query MUST include:
    - Exact team name(s) as provided (never modify or substitute)
    - Recency indicator: "recent", "latest", "this season", "2024", "today", etc.
    - Negative/roast keyword: "failures", "losses", "worst", "embarrassing", "bad", "struggles", "controversy", "defeats", "weaknesses"
    
    INTENSITY ADJUSTMENT:
    - low: General stats, recent form, basic comparisons
    - medium: Include failures, losses, weaknesses
    - high: Emphasize embarrassing moments, bad streaks, controversies
    - extreme: Include memes, social media reactions, viral failures, most negative content
