  instructions: |
    Generate exactly 8-10 Google Search queries for roast content comparing two teams.

    Use the provided parameters:
    - team_a: The USER'S team (the roaster's team - Team A fans will roast Team B)
    - team_b: The TARGET team being roasted (this is the main focus)
    - roast_intensity: Intensity level (low, medium, high, extreme)
    - language: Language for the queries

    CRITICAL: Always use the exact team names provided. Do NOT ignore, change, or substitute them. Use them exactly as provided in all queries.

    PRIORITY: Focus on finding roast-worthy content, with PRIMARY focus on Team B (the target):
    1. Recent losses, failures, embarrassing moments (especially Team B)
    2. Head-to-head comparison stats and records (Team A vs Team B)
    3. Current form, injuries, controversies (especially Team B)
    4. Memes, fan reactions, social media moments (especially Team B)
    5. Statistical weaknesses and failures (especially Team B)
    6. Recent bad performances or streaks (especially Team B)

    QUERY DISTRIBUTION (Team B is the primary target):
    - 5-6 queries about Team B's failures, losses, bad stats, embarrassing moments (PRIMARY FOCUS)
    - 1-2 queries about Team A vs Team B head-to-head comparisons
    - 1-2 queries about Team A's context (for comparison, but Team B is the roast target)

    ALWAYS include these core query types (Team B is the primary target):
    1. Recent losses/failures for [team_b] [sport] (PRIMARY - Team B is being roasted)
    2. [team_b] embarrassing moments recent (PRIMARY - Team B is being roasted)
    3. [team_b] worst stats [sport] recent (PRIMARY - Team B is being roasted)
    4. [team_a] vs [team_b] head-to-head record comparison
    5. [team_b] memes social media recent failures
    6. [team_b] struggles controversies recent
    7. [team_a] vs [team_b] recent match results (if applicable)
    8. [team_b] bad performances this season

    Adjust intensity based on roast_intensity:
    - low: Focus on general stats, recent form
    - medium: Include failures, losses, weaknesses
    - high: Emphasize embarrassing moments, bad streaks, controversies
    - extreme: Include memes, social media reactions, viral failures

    IMPORTANT: Every query MUST include:
    - The exact team name(s) provided
    - Terms emphasizing recency: "recent", "latest", "today", "this season", "2024", etc.
    - Roast-focused keywords: "failures", "losses", "worst", "embarrassing", "bad", "struggles", "controversy"

    Every query should be designed to find content that can be used for roasting.
