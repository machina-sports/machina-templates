  title: Roast Agent Generate Search Queries - Team A Wins & Trash Talk
  description: "Generate search queries to find Team A's recent wins, victories, and trash talk points against Team B"
  instructions: |
    Generate Google Search queries to find Team A's wins, victories, and trash talk points against Team B.
    
    PARAMETERS PROVIDED:
    - team_a: The actual team name (e.g., "warriors", "lakers", "celtics") - USE THIS EXACT VALUE
    - team_b: The actual team name being roasted (e.g., "lakers", "warriors", "heat") - USE THIS EXACT VALUE
    - language: Language code for queries
    - roast_intensity: Intensity level (low, medium, high)

    CRITICAL: You MUST replace "Team A" and "Team B" with the ACTUAL team names provided in the parameters.
    DO NOT use placeholders like "Team A" or "Team B" in your output queries.
    DO NOT use "[team_a]" or "[team_b]" - use the actual team names directly.

    YOUR TASK:
    Generate 3-4 search queries that find Team A's positive content and victories against Team B.
    Use the ACTUAL team names from the parameters in EVERY query.
    
    REQUIRED QUERY TYPES (generate all of these):
    1. [ACTUAL_TEAM_A_NAME] recent wins and victories against [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME]
    2. [ACTUAL_TEAM_A_NAME] vs [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME] head-to-head record (showing dominance)
    3. [ACTUAL_TEAM_A_NAME] best performances against [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME]
    4. [ACTUAL_TEAM_A_NAME] trash talk, celebrations, or dominant moments vs [ACTUAL_TEAM_B_NAME]

    QUERY FORMAT:
    Every query MUST:
    - Start with the ACTUAL team_a name (not "Team A")
    - Include the ACTUAL team_b name (not "Team B")
    - Include positive keywords: "wins", "victories", "beat", "defeated", "dominated", "record", "best", "trash talk", "celebrations"
    - Include recency: "recent", "latest", "this season", "2024", "today"
    
    CONCRETE EXAMPLES (if team_a="warriors" and team_b="lakers"):
    - "warriors vs lakers recent wins victories"
    - "warriors beat lakers head-to-head record"
    - "warriors best performances against lakers this season"
    - "warriors trash talk lakers celebrations recent"

    INTENSITY ADJUSTMENTS:
    - low: Focus on general head-to-head records
    - medium: Include recent wins and victories
    - high: Emphasize dominant performances, trash talk, celebrations, viral moments, and savage content

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - EVERY query must include BOTH actual team names (team_a and team_b values)
    - NEVER use "Team A" or "Team B" - always use the actual team names
    - Focus on Team A's SUCCESSES and VICTORIES
    - Show Team A dominating or beating Team B
    - Use the exact team names as provided in the parameters
    - All queries should be positive for Team A, negative context for Team B

    OUTPUT:
    Generate exactly 3-4 queries in the specified language.
    Each query must contain the actual team names, not placeholders.
    Output only the queries array in the schema format.
