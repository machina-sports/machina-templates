Generate a 16/9 widescreen landscape image (1920x1080 or equivalent proportions) that blends classic architecture and motion, capturing timeless heritage meeting modern speed. CONTEXT This image is for a podcast about {{favorite_sport}} tailored for fans of {{favorite_team}}. The podcast script discusses {{audio_content}} Reference images have been provided based on these queries {{image_queries}}. Use these reference images as visual inspiration, but recreate the composition without any watermarks, logos, text overlays, copyright marks, or branding. If reference images contain watermarks or text, recreate those visual elements without them. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTELY NO text, words, letters, numbers, typography, or written elements anywhere in the image - completely text-free\n- ABSOLUTELY NO player names, player references, or individual athletes - focus only on architectural elements, stadiums, team colors, motion, heritage, and cinematic composition\n- Only incorporate visual elements, teams, and concepts that correspond to the provided reference images and image queries\n- The image must celebrate {{favorite_team}}s identity and spirit through team colors, architectural elements, and visual symbolism DESIGN STYLE Create a realistic photographic composition with cinematic qualities (NOT abstract, NOT graphic design). The composition should feel like a retro-futuristic travel poster - poetic, fast, slightly surreal, suspended between memory and motion. The subject should convey elegance, power, and history — like an icon of culture meeting a symbol of velocity. Use minimal, editorial framing suitable for podcast headers. COLOR PALETTE Use a warm, muted palette with gentle light leaks and shadows suggesting analog photography. Incorporate soft, nostalgic tones that evoke film-grain texture. Integrate {{favorite_team}}s primary and secondary team colors throughout the composition in a subtle, cinematic way that maintains the dreamlike aesthetic. Weave the team colors into the warm muted palette, light leaks, shadows, and overall color scheme. Use deep shadows and warm highlights to create depth and atmosphere. Avoid overly saturated or flat colors - maintain the dreamlike, cinematic quality while incorporating team colors. Use color relationships to create the feeling of timeless heritage, incorporating {{favorite_team}}s colors as part of that heritage. COMPOSITION Create a cinematic, dreamlike composition with soft diffusion. Blend classic architecture and motion in the frame. Use minimal, editorial framing with balanced visual hierarchy. Employ strategic use of negative space and composition flow. Create depth through realistic layering, depth of field, and cinematic perspective. Arrange visual elements to represent the story and themes from the podcast content. The composition should feel like a retro-futuristic travel poster - poetic and slightly surreal. VISUAL EFFECTS Apply heavy motion blur to elements suggesting speed and movement. Use soft diffusion throughout to create dreamlike, cinematic quality. Apply nostalgic film-grain texture to the entire image. Include gentle light leaks and shadows suggesting analog photography. Use realistic photographic effects depth of field, motion blur, lens flares, atmospheric haze. The final image should feel suspended between memory and motion. Maintain realistic rendering with cinematic, dreamlike qualities. The image must be completely free of text, words, letters, numbers, typography, or written elements. It must be 16/9 widescreen landscape aspect ratio (1920x1080 or equivalent proportions). It must be CINEMATIC and DREAMLIKE - a realistic photographic composition with retro-futuristic travel poster aesthetic, poetic, fast, slightly surreal, suspended between memory and motion.'"
