          "Create a CINEMATIC, DREAMLIKE visual composition suitable for podcast headers. CONTEXT This image is for a podcast about {{favorite_sport}} tailored for fans of {{favorite_team}}. Reference images have been provided based on these queries {{image_queries}}. REFERENCE IMAGE REQUIREMENTS - Use the provided reference images exactly as they are - DO NOT change, modify, alter, or recreate them. Especially preserve team logos exactly as they appear in the reference images.\n- Combine the multiple reference images into a single cohesive image. Keep all key subjects recognizable and maintain their proportions and details. Blend the images naturally with consistent lighting, shadows, perspective, and style. Photorealistic, high-resolution, seamless integration.\n- Integrate the reference images seamlessly into the composition so they feel like natural, integral parts of the design.\n- The reference images may include team logos, stadiums, mascots, and other team-related visual elements - incorporate all of these without modification. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTELY NO text, words, letters, numbers, typography, or written elements anywhere in the image\n- ABSOLUTELY NO player names, player references, or individual athletes\n- Reference images must be prominently visible and seamlessly integrated\n- Only incorporate visual elements that correspond to the provided reference images DESIGN STYLE Create a realistic photographic composition with cinematic qualities. The composition should feel like a retro-futuristic travel poster - poetic, fast, slightly surreal, suspended between memory and motion. Use minimal, editorial framing suitable for podcast headers. COLOR PALETTE Use a warm, muted palette with gentle light leaks and shadows suggesting analog photography. Incorporate soft, nostalgic tones that evoke film-grain texture. Integrate {{favorite_team}}s primary and secondary team colors throughout the composition in a subtle, cinematic way. Extract team colors from the reference images and use them throughout. Use deep shadows and warm highlights to create depth and atmosphere. Maintain the dreamlike, cinematic quality while incorporating team colors. COMPOSITION Create a cinematic, dreamlike composition with soft diffusion. Integrate the reference images seamlessly - they should appear as natural, integral parts of the overall design. Use minimal, editorial framing with balanced visual hierarchy. Create depth through realistic layering, depth of field, and cinematic perspective. The composition should feel like a retro-futuristic travel poster - poetic and slightly surreal. VISUAL EFFECTS Apply motion blur to elements suggesting speed and movement. Use soft diffusion throughout to create dreamlike, cinematic quality. Apply nostalgic film-grain texture to the entire image. Include gentle light leaks and shadows suggesting analog photography. Use realistic photographic effects: depth of field, motion blur, lens flares, atmospheric haze. The reference images should remain recognizable while being rendered with cinematic effects. The final image should feel suspended between memory and motion. Maintain realistic rendering with cinematic, dreamlike qualities. MANDATORY: The image MUST be in 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 or equivalent proportions). This is REQUIRED."
