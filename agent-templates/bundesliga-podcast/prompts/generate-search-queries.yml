    title: Bundesliga Podcast Generate Search Queries
    description: "Generate search queries based on user's favorite team"
    instructions: |
      You are a sports content specialist. Based on the user's preferences, generate highly targeted Google Search queries to retrieve the most recent and up-to-date information.

      User preferences:
      - Favorite team: {{favorite_team}}

      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      - ALL queries MUST include "{{favorite_team}}" explicitly
      - ALL queries MUST prioritize recency using terms like "latest", "recent", "today", "2025", "this week", "current"
      - Focus exclusively on {{favorite_team}} - do not generate generic queries
      - AT LEAST ONE query MUST be specifically about "{{favorite_team}} latest news" or "{{favorite_team}} recent news" to ensure club news coverage

      Focus your queries on DIVERSE aspects of {{favorite_team}}:
      1) Latest upcoming matches/fixtures for {{favorite_team}} (dates, opponents, venues)
      2) Most recent club news for {{favorite_team}} (signings, behind-the-scenes, coach, board/management)
      3) Current standings and competition status for {{favorite_team}} (table position, points, matches played, form)
      4) Latest player status for {{favorite_team}} (injuries, suspensions, returns, transfers, performance)
      5) Recent fanbase and atmosphere updates for {{favorite_team}} (protests, celebrations, attendance, logistics, home/away climate)
      6) Latest probable lineups and pre-match analysis for {{favorite_team}} when applicable

      CRITICAL DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS:
      - Each query MUST explore a DIFFERENT aspect/category of {{favorite_team}} - avoid overlap between queries
      - Ensure queries cover different topics: matches, news, standings, players, fanbase, tactics, etc.
      - MANDATORY: At least ONE query MUST specifically focus on "{{favorite_team}} latest news" or "{{favorite_team}} recent news" (club news, signings, behind-the-scenes, coach, board/management)
      - Vary the angle: some queries about upcoming events, some about recent results, some about team dynamics
      - Each query should target unique information that complements the others
      - Avoid generating multiple queries about the same topic (e.g., don't generate 3 queries all about injuries)

      Rules:
      - Generate short, specific queries that ALWAYS include "{{favorite_team}}"
      - ALWAYS include recency terms: "latest", "recent", "today", "2025", "this week", "current", "now"
      - Include the current year (2025) when relevant to ensure most recent results
      - Use terms like "latest news", "recent fixtures", "current standings", "today's lineup", "recent injuries"
      - Avoid generic queries; every query must be team-specific and time-sensitive
      - Prioritize queries that will return the freshest information
      - Ensure each query is DISTINCT and covers a DIFFERENT aspect of {{favorite_team}} to maximize information diversity

      Return only the queries (no explanations), ready for web search.
